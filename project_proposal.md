# Project Proposal

## Our question and data set
  Our question is the following: “What factors affect the price of an Airbnb in New York?” The dataset we have was found on the Kaggle dataset listing, with a title of “New York City Airbnb Open Data”: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data. The columns it contains are name, host_id, location, type of a room, price, reviews and so on. 


## Why the problem is important
  House owners can have a reference when they are setting the price;
Consumers feel more comfortable and confident when having better understanding of how prices are determined;
Airbnb can set regulatory policies regarding prices;


## How the data set will answer our question
  Our data set contains price for each room along with other features that could be associated with it, such as location, room type and so on. By drawing the correlation between each feature, we can draw a conclusion of which factors have influence on the price and by how much each one affects it.
