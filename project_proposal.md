## Project Proposal

**Our question and data set**
  Our question is the following: “What factors affect the price of an Airbnb in New York?” The dataset we have was found on the Kaggle dataset listing, with a title of “New York City Airbnb Open Data”: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data. The columns it contains are name, host_id, location, type of a room, price, reviews and so on.
